PROJECTS
--------
**SC Birth Outcomes Initiative Portal, 2019** [https://boi.ifsreports.com/]  
The BOI interactive dashboard provides users with an instant visual representation of the statewide maternal and birth outcomes metrics – across payment, individual, facility-level, and geographical characteristics. Users can filter, print, and share these data. The dashboard is a tool that facilitates data-driven collaborative decisions to improve the clinical outcomes of mothers and babies in SC.

> **Notable Features:** Play Framework for Java, Dynamic Data Visualization (ChartJS), Responsive and Mobile-First UI (Bootstrap), Database Integration and Management (PostgreSQL, pgAdmin).

> **Notable Challenge(s):** After launch a portion of the Portal's User-base were not recieving the best user experience, this was because these Users were using older browsers to access the Portal, namely Internet Explorer (IE11). The Portal was developed using modern technologies and code syntax, all of which was not supported by IE11 at the time. For that same User group it was also not fesible for them to upgrade or switch their workstation's and work device's web browsers because of internal and on-site IT policies. To bridge this compatibility gap two development techniques were implemented – code transpiling and polyfilling. The codebase was transpiled into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript and to support JavaScript features that couldn’t be transpiled a polyfill package was created and conditionally loaded only to those browsers that need it so that performance wouldn't be impacted for browsers that did not.


**Exploring South Carolina's Social Determinants of Health, 2019** [http://bit.ly/2rLFSt0]  
This interactive story was built using ArcGIS Storymaps. This visualization tool allows users to explore the social determinants that influence the health of residents in South Carolina. It provides strategic recommendations for achieving cost-effective optimal outcomes for health care systems by exploring the roles health disparity, health equity, and social determinants of health play in health outcomes.
